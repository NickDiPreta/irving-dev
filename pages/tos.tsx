//             Credit Starter TERMS OF USE Last Modified: January 29, 2020 Welcome
//             to Credit Starter’s website (the “Company Site”), owned and operated
//             by Credit Starter, Inc. (“Company,” “we,” or “us”). This page
//             explains the terms by which you may use the Company Site, and our
//             services and software provided on or in connection with the services
//             (collectively, the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, or
//             clicking a button or checking a box marked “I Agree” or something
//             similar, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be
//             bound by these Terms of Use (these “Terms”), to the collection and
//             use of your information as set forth in the Company Privacy Policy,
//             which is hereby incorporated by reference. These Terms apply to all
//             visitors, users, and others who register for or otherwise access the
//             Service (“Users”). Certain services may be subject to additional
//             terms and conditions specified by us from time to time, and your use
//             of such services is subject to those additional terms and
//             conditions, which are hereby incorporated into these Terms by
//             reference. Please read this agreement carefully to ensure that you
//             understand each provision. These Terms contain a mandatory
//             individual arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver provision
//             that requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis to
//             resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions. 1. Use

//             Company. You must read and agree to these terms before using the
//             Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service. You may
//             use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with
//             Company, and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable
//             local, state, national, and international laws, rules and

//             strictly prohibited and in violation of these Terms. You must be a
//             resident of the United States with a United States mailing address.
//             The Service is not available to any Users previously removed from
//             the Service by Company. 2. Company Service and App Company Services
//             include the following key features: (a) access to certain offers for
//             financial products and services by third party financial
//             institutions; and (b) reporting of data provided by you or third
//             parties to credit reporting agencies. The Company may report User
//             Content (as defined below) by you or a third party to a credit
//             reporting agency, which may assist in establishing a credit history
//             and/or a credit score for the individual for whom the User Content
//             relates. In order to use certain aspects of the Services, you will
//             need to provide Company with certain information required by
//             Company, including, personal information (name, email address,
//             password, phone number, date of birth, social security number,
//             addresses) about the individual for whom the User Content relates,
//             information relating to the reporter of User Content and rental or
//             bill payment information (amount due and payment dates) and any
//             information necessary for Company to verify and validate the
//             information. Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, you
//             are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable,
//             freely revocable license to use the Service for your personal,
//             noncommercial use only and as permitted by the features of the
//             Service. Company reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in
//             the Service and the Company Content (as defined below). Company may
//             terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason. We
//             may make available software to access the Service via a mobile
//             device (the “App”). To use the App you must have a mobile device
//             that is compatible with the App. Company does not warrant that the
//             App will be compatible with your mobile device. You may use mobile
//             data in connection with the App and may incur additional charges
//             from your wireless provider for these services. You agree that you
//             are solely responsible for any such charges. Company hereby grants
//             you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use a
//             compiled code copy of the App for one Company account on one mobile
//             device owned or leased solely by you, for your personal use. You may
//             not: (i) modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the App,
//             except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited
//             by law; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell, sublicense, distribute or
//             otherwise transfer the App to any third party or use the App to
//             provide time sharing or similar services for any third party; (iii)
//             make any copies of the App; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable, damage
//             or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the App,
//             features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content
//             accessible through the App, or features that enforce limitations on
//             use of the App; or (v) delete the copyright and other proprietary
//             rights notices on the App. You acknowledge that Company may from
//             time to time issue upgraded versions of the App, and may
//             automatically electronically upgrade the version of the App that you
//             are using on your mobile device. You consent to such automatic
//             upgrading on your mobile device, and agree that the terms and
//             conditions of these Terms will apply to all such upgrades. Any
//             third-party code that may be incorporated in the App is covered by
//             the applicable open source or third-party license EULA, if any,
//             authorizing use of such code. The foregoing license grant is not a
//             sale of the App or any copy thereof, and Company or its third-party
//             partners or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in the
//             App (and any copy thereof). Any attempt by you to transfer any of
//             the rights, duties or obligations hereunder, except as expressly
//             provided for in these Terms, is void. Company reserves all rights
//             not expressly granted under these Terms. If the App is being
//             acquired on behalf of the United States Government, then the
//             following provision applies. The App will be deemed to be
//             “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software
//             documentation,” respectively, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202 and
//             FAR Section 12.212, as applicable. Any use, reproduction, release,
//             performance, display or disclosure of the Service and any
//             accompanying documentation by the U.S. Government will be governed
//             solely by these Terms of Service and is prohibited except to the
//             extent expressly permitted by these Terms of Service. The App
//             originates in the United States, and is subject to United States
//             export laws and regulations. The App may not be exported or
//             re-exported to certain countries or those persons or entities
//             prohibited from receiving exports from the United States. In
//             addition, the App may be subject to the import and export laws of
//             other countries. You agree to comply with all United States and
//             foreign laws related to use of the App and the Service. 3. Company
//             Accounts Your Company account gives you access to the services and
//             functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time
//             and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of
//             accounts for different types of Users. If you open a Company account
//             on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then (a)
//             “you” includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and
//             warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with
//             the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and that you agree
//             to these Terms on the entity’s behalf. You may never use another
//             User’s account without permission. When creating your account, you
//             must provide accurate and complete information required by Company,
//             and you must keep this information up to date. You are solely
//             responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you
//             must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use
//             “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and
//             lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must
//             notify Company immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized
//             use of your account. Company will not be liable for any losses
//             caused by any unauthorized use of your account. You will not
//             activate multiple Company accounts without Company’s prior consent.
//             By providing Company your email address you consent to our using the
//             email address to send you Service-related notices, including any
//             notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We
//             may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as
//             changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not
//             want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your
//             preferences in your settings. Opting out may prevent you from
//             receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.
//             4. User Information, Reporting and Credit Report Authorization We
//             may permit you to submit personal or financial information related
//             to you or your customers in order for Company to provide to third
//             parties, including credit reporting agencies, and to use for its
//             purposes (“User Content”). By submitting to Company User Content,
//             you grant to Company and its affiliates a perpetual, irrevocable,
//             royalty-free, worldwide, sublicensable and transferable license to

//             from, distribute, reproduce, sell, display, transmit, publish,
//             broadcast, host, archive, store, cache, use or otherwise exploit all
//             or any portion of the User Content, in any commercial or
//             noncommercial manner whatsoever, for any purposes that complies with
//             applicable law with or without attribution and without further
//             notice to you. Neither you, nor any other person or entity, will
//             have the right to (i) receive any royalty or consideration of any
//             kind for the use of the User Content pursuant to these Terms or (ii)
//             inspect or approve the editorial copy or other material that may be
//             used in connection with the User Content. By submitting User Content
//             to Company, you represent and warrant that (i) you own or control
//             any and all rights in and to the User Content, and the right to
//             grant all of the rights and licenses in these Terms, and if you are
//             not the holder of such rights, the holder of such rights has
//             completely and effectively waived all such rights and irrevocably
//             granted you the right to grant the licenses stated above without the
//             need for payment to you or any other person or entity; (ii) you have
//             obtained permission from any individuals that the User Content
//             relate to in order for Company to use, and grant others the right to
//             use, User Content in accordance with the Terms without the need for
//             payment to you or any other person or entity; and (iii) the User
//             Content does not (a) contain false or misleading information, (b)
//             infringe on the intellectual property, privacy, publicity,
//             statutory, contractual or other rights of any third party, (c)
//             contain any libelous, defamatory, obscene, offensive, threatening or
//             otherwise harassing or hateful content, or (d) contain computer
//             viruses, worms or other harmful files. Upon request by Company, you
//             will furnish Company any documentation, substantiation or releases
//             necessary to verify your compliance with these Terms. You are solely
//             responsible for the User Content and you hereby agree to indemnify
//             and hold Company and its employees, agents, affiliates, assigns and
//             licensees harmless from any and all damages, claims, expenses, costs
//             or fees arising from or in connection with a breach of any of the
//             foregoing representations or your violation of any law or rights of
//             a third party. If you are submitting User Content as a landlord,
//             financial service provider, wireless carrier or any retailer
//             providing consumer products or services, you agree, represent and
//             warrant that you are submitting User Content in compliance with the
//             federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”). Company is not liable
//             for any actions or omissions of any party submitting User Content,
//             including actions and omissions of landlord, financial service
//             provider, wireless carrier and any retailer. You authorize your
//             landlord, wireless operator and any other third party providing
//             services to you to disclose to Company and its affiliates personal
//             and financial information about you, including your name, number,
//             email address, rent payment, billing and payment information and
//             account status (such information to be considered User Content). You
//             further authorize Company to disclose or report any User Content or
//             any other information collected in connection with the Services to
//             credit reporting agencies and other third parties. Any late
//             payments, missed payments or other defaults on accounts, including
//             rental or wireless carrier accounts, reported to us may be reflected
//             in your credit report. Once payments have been reported by Company
//             to a credit reporting agency, the reporting of those payments cannot
//             be modified, amended or canceled, unless otherwise permitted by law,
//             and the cessation of the reporting any payments to a credit
//             reporting agency may negatively impact your credit history. Company
//             shall not be liable for any claims, charges, demands, damages or
//             adverse impacts on your credit score or credit history if you cease
//             using the Services or the Services are no longer available to you,
//             whether or not Company is at fault. Notwithstanding the above, any
//             party may dispute any entry on a credit report provided by Company
//             to a credit reporting agency pursuant to the FCRA. If Company
//             determines that any User Content is inaccurate, it may request that
//             you update the User Content or may update the User Content without
//             liability to you or consent from you. At Company’s sole discretion,
//             any User Content may be included in the Services in whole or in part
//             in modified form without liability to you. In addition, Company
//             shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion
//             to refuse or remove any User Content that is available or submitted
//             via the Services that violates these Terms. Notwithstanding anything
//             here, Company is not responsible for detecting or correcting any
//             errors and you acknowledge that the accuracy and completeness of
//             User Content you submit to Company is your sole responsibility.
//             Under no circumstances will Company be liable in any way for any
//             User Content submitted by you. Company is an independent company not
//             related to any credit reporting agency, and the Company is not
//             responsible for how any credit reporting agency may manage or use
//             the information provided to them. You hereby agree to hold Company
//             harmless against any such claims (all subject to the FCRA and the
//             Credit Reporting Dispute Resolution Policy. Please consult the
//             credit reporting agency for the terms and conditions of how they
//             collect, store, manage, use, modify, disseminate and distribute such
//             information. Once the User Content is transmitted from Company to
//             the credit reporting agency, that credit reporting agency will
//             obtain an ownership interest in that User Content. You also
//             authorize Company and its affiliates to obtain from third parties,
//             public bodies or credit reporting agencies any information required
//             to verify your identity or any information or User Content reported
//             to Company or provide Services to you. This may include verification
//             of any reported payments or agreements between you and a third party
//             (e.g., landlord, wireless carrier, etc.). Company may also require
//             you to verify contact information and any financial accounts related
//             to or accessed using the Services. If Company is unable to verify
//             your information, it may deny Service to you. 5. Service Rules You

//             period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser (except
//             that Company grants the operators of public search engines revocable
//             permission to use spiders to copy publically available materials
//             from the Company Site for the sole purpose of and solely to the

//             or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers
//             running the Service; (v) taking any action that imposes, or may

//             access to the Service, including without limitation features that
//             prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce
//             limitations on use of the Service or the content therein. We may,
//             without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service
//             or features of the Service, to you or to Users generally; or create
//             usage limits for the Service. We may permanently or temporarily
//             terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and

//             these Terms. 2. Our Proprietary Rights The Service and all materials

//             non-infringement. No advice or information, whether oral or written,
//             obtained by you from Company or through the Service will create any
//             warranty not expressly stated herein. Without limiting the

//             the completeness, accuracy, reliability or usefulness of any user

//             or in any way monitor any transaction between you and third-party.

//             allow the exclusion and limitations of certain implied warranties,
//             so the above exclusions may not apply to you. This agreement gives
//             you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which
//             vary from state to state. The disclaimers and exclusions under this
//             agreement will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.
//             9. Limitation of Liability To the maximum extent permitted by
//             applicable law, in no event shall Company, its affiliates, agents,
//             directors, employees, suppliers or licensors be liable for any
//             indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary
//             damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits,
//             goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, arising out of or
//             relating to the use of, or inability to use, this service. Under no
//             circumstances will Company be responsible for any damage, loss or
//             injury resulting from hacking, tampering or other unauthorized
//             access or use of the Service or your account, User Content, or the
//             information contained therein. To the maximum extent permitted by
//             applicable law, Company assumes no liability or responsibility for
//             any (i) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content or User
//             Content; (ii) personal injury or property damage, of any nature
//             whatsoever, resulting from your access to or use of our service;
//             (iii) any unauthorized access to or use of our secure servers and/or
//             any and all personal information or User Content stored therein;
//             (iv) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the
//             Service; (v) any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may

//             of any third party. In no event shall Company, its affiliates,
//             agents, directors, employees, suppliers, or licensors be liable to
//             you for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages,
//             losses or costs in an amount exceeding the amount you paid to
//             Company hereunder or $100.00, whichever is greater. This limitation
//             of liability section applies whether the alleged liability is based
//             on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis,
//             even if Company has been advised of the possibility of such damage.
//             The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest
//             extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction. Some states
//             do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
//             consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may
//             not apply to you. This agreement gives you specific legal rights,
//             and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state.
//             The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under this
//             agreement will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.
//             The Service is controlled and operated from facilities in the United
//             States and is only intended for use in the United States. Company
//             makes no representations that the Service is appropriate or
//             available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the
//             Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are
//             entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United
//             States and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to
//             export and import regulations. You may not use the Service if you
//             are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a
//             foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States
//             government. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found
//             on the Service are solely directed to individuals, companies, or
//             other entities located in the United States. 10. Governing Law,
//             Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver 1. Governing Law.
//             You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in
//             California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that
//             does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific
//             or general, in jurisdictions other than California. These Terms
//             shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of
//             California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The
//             parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction
//             involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding
//             sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration
//             conducted pursuant to the terms of these Terms shall be governed by
//             the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of
//             the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
//             Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the
//             personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Los
//             Angeles, California for any actions for which we retain the right to
//             seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent
//             jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
//             misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade
//             secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary
//             rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including
//             any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You
//             agree that Los Angeles, California is the proper forum for any
//             appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in
//             the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be
//             unenforceable. 2. Arbitration. Read this section carefully because
//             it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the
//             manner in which you can seek relief from Company. For any dispute
//             with Company, you agree to first contact us at team@hatch.credit and
//             attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely
//             event that Company has not been able to resolve a dispute it has
//             with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim,
//             dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or
//             other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in
//             connection with or relating to these Terms, or the breach or alleged
//             breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by
//             JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in
//             effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at
//             www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in Los Angeles,
//             California, unless you and Company agree otherwise. If you are using
//             the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible
//             for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in
//             accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator
//             shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and
//             reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an
//             individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS
//             may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless
//             you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii)
//             the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of
//             arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable
//             costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a
//             small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging
//             in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to
//             engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on
//             the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of
//             competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as
//             preventing Company from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief
//             from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened
//             infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security,
//             Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights. 3. Class
//             Action/Jury Trial Waiver. With respect to all persons and entities,
//             regardless of whether they have obtained or used the Service for
//             personal, commercial or other purposes, all claims must be brought
//             in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class
//             member in any purported class action, collective action, private
//             attorney general action or other representative proceeding. This
//             waiver applies to class arbitration, and, unless we agree otherwise,
//             the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims.
//             You agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and Company are
//             each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a
//             class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or
//             other representative proceeding of any kind. 11. Additional App
//             Store Terms 1. App from Apple App Store. The following applies to

//             software. You acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party
//             claim that the Apple-Sourced Software or your possession and use of
//             that Apple-Sourced Software infringes that third party’s
//             intellectual property rights, Company, not Apple, will be solely
//             responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge
//             of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent
