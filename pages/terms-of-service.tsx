        reporting of data provided by you or third parties to credit reporting

        services. You agree that you are solely responsible for any such
        charges. Company hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable,

        of the App; or (v) delete the copyright and other proprietary rights
        notices on the App. You acknowledge that Company may from time to time
        issue upgraded versions of the App, and may automatically electronically

        You consent to such automatic upgrading on your mobile device and agree
        that the terms and conditions of these Terms will apply to all such
        upgrades. Any third-party code that may be incorporated in the App is
        covered by the applicable open source or third-party license EULA, if
        any, authorizing use of such code. The foregoing license grant is not a
        sale of the App or any copy thereof, and Company or its third-party
        partners or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in the App
        (and any copy thereof). Any attempt by you to transfer any of the
        rights, duties, or obligations hereunder, except as expressly provided
        for in these Terms, is void. Company reserves all rights not expressly
        granted under these Terms. If the App is being acquired on behalf of the

        will be deemed to be “commercial computer software” and “commercial
        computer software documentation,” respectively, pursuant to DFAR Section

        permitted by these Terms of Service. The App originates in the United
        States and is subject to United States export laws and regulations. The
        App may not be exported or re-exported to certain countries or those
        persons or entities prohibited from receiving exports from the United
        States. In addition, the App may be subject to the import and export
        laws of other countries. You agree to comply with all United States and
        foreign laws related to use of the App and the Service. User Accounts.

        the Service and functionality that we may establish and maintain from

        of accounts for different types of Users. If you open a Company account
        on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then (a) “you”

        you represent and warrant that (i) you own or control any and all rights
        in and to the User Content, and the right to grant all of the rights and
        licenses in these Terms, and if you are not the holder of such rights,
        the holder of such rights has completely and effectively waived all such
        rights and irrevocably granted you the right to grant the licenses
        stated above without the need for payment to you or any other person or
        entity; (ii) you have obtained permission from any individuals that the

        any documentation, substantiation, or releases necessary to verify your
        compliance with these Terms. You are solely responsible for the User
        Content and you hereby agree to indemnify and hold Company and its
        employees, agents, affiliates, assigns, and licensees harmless from any
        and all damages, claims, expenses, costs, or fees arising from or in
        connection with a breach of any of the foregoing representations or your
        violation of any law or rights of a third party. If you are submitting

        User Content in compliance with the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act
        (“FCRA”), and you will ensure compliance with FCRA. You agree to defend,
        indemnify, and hold harmless Company for any losses related to your
        failure to comply with FCRA or submission of User Content. You
        understand that we may contact third parties, including landlords,
        financial service providers, wireless carriers or retailers related to

        connection with User Content, including actions and omissions of the
        landlord, financial service provider, wireless carrier, and any

        third party providing services to you to disclose to Company and its
        affiliates personal and financial information about you, including your
        name, number, email address, rent payment, billing and payment
        information, and account status (such information to be considered User
        Content). You further authorize the Company to disclose or report any
        User Content or any other information collected in connection with the
        Services to credit reporting agencies and other third parties. Any late
        payments, missed payments or other defaults on accounts, including
        rental or wireless carrier accounts, reported to us may be reflected in
        your credit report. Once payments have been reported by the Company to a
        credit reporting agency, the reporting of those payments cannot be
        modified, amended or canceled, unless otherwise permitted by law, and
        the cessation of the reporting of any payments to a credit reporting
        agency may negatively impact your credit history. Company shall not be
        liable for any claims, charges, demands, damages, or adverse impacts on
        your credit score or credit history if you cease using the Service or
        the Service is no longer available to you, whether or not the Company is
        at fault. Notwithstanding the above, any party may dispute any entry on
        a credit report provided by Company to a credit reporting agency
        pursuant to the FCRA. If a Company determines that any User Content is
        inaccurate, it may request that you update the User Content or may
        update the User Content Without liability to you or consent from you,
        subject to applicable law. At Company’s sole discretion, any User
        Content may be included in the Service in whole or in part in modified
        form without liability to you. In addition, Company shall have the right
        (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to refuse or remove any
        User Content that is available or submitted via the Service that
        violates these Terms. Notwithstanding anything here, the Company is not
        responsible for detecting/correcting any errors and you acknowledge that
        the accuracy and completeness of User Content you submit to Company is
        your sole responsibility. Under no circumstances will the Company be
        liable in any way for any User Content submitted by you. Company is an
        independent company not related to any credit reporting agency, and the
        Company is not responsible for how many credit reporting agencies may
        manage or use the information provided to them. You hereby agree to hold
        Company harmless against any such claims (all subject to the FCRA).
        Please consult the credit reporting agency for the terms and conditions
        of how they collect, store, manage, use, modify, disseminate, and
        distribute such information. Once the User Content is transmitted from
        Company to the credit reporting agency, that credit reporting agency
        will obtain an ownership interest in that User Content. You also
        authorize Company and its affiliates to obtain from third parties,
        public bodies, or credit reporting agencies any information required to
        verify your identity or any information or User Content reported to
        Company or provide the Service to you. This may include verification of
        any reported payments or agreements between you and a third party (e.g.,
        landlord, wireless carrier, etc.). Company may also require you to
        verify contact information and any financial accounts related to or
        accessed using the Service. If the Company is unable to verify your
        information, it may deny Service to you. Service Rules You agree not to

        Federal law, some states, provinces, and other jurisdictions do not
        allow the exclusion and limitations of certain implied warranties, so
        the above exclusions may not apply to you. This agreement gives you
        specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary
        from state to state. The disclaimers and exclusions under this agreement
        will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law. Limitation of
        Liability To The maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event
        shall Company, its affiliates, agents, directors, employees, suppliers,
        or licensors be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special,
        consequential, or exemplary damages, including without limitation
        damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible
        losses, arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use,
        this Service. Under no circumstances will Company be responsible for any
        damage, loss, or injury resulting from hacking, tampering, or other
        unauthorized access or use of the Service or your account, User Content,
        or the information contained therein. To the maximum extent permitted by
        applicable law, Company assumes no liability or responsibility for any
        (i) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content or User Content; (ii)
        personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting

        or costs in an amount exceeding the amount you paid to Company hereunder

        applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort,
        negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if the Company
        has been advised of the possibility of such damage. The foregoing
        limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by
        law in the applicable jurisdiction. Some states do not allow the
        exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the
        above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. This agreement
        gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights
        which vary from state to state. The disclaimers, exclusions, and
        limitations of liability under this agreement will not apply to the
        extent prohibited by applicable law. Service Location The Service is
        controlled and operated from facilities in the United States and is only

        their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all
        applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including but
        not limited to export and import regulations. You may not use the

        companies, or other entities located in the United States. Governing
        Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver Governing Law. You
        agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California;
        and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give
        rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in
        jurisdictions other than California. These Terms shall be governed by
        the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without
        respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that
        these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce.
        Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive
        law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of these Terms
        shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). You
        agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state
        courts located in Los Angeles, California for any actions for which we
        retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court
        of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened
        infringement, misappropriation or violation of our copyrights,
        trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or
        proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below,
        including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm.
        You agree that Los Angeles, California is the proper forum for any
        appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the
        event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.
        Arbitration. READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES
        TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK
        RELIEF FROM THE COMPANY. For any dispute with the Company, you agree to
        first contact us at support@getperch.app and attempt to resolve the
        dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Company has not
        been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we
        each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any
        claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below)
        arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or the
        breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding
        arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures
        then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be
        contacted at www.jams adr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in Los
        Angeles, California, unless you and Company agree otherwise. If you are
        using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be
        responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator
        fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the
        arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’
        fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an
        individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may
        require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you
        apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award
        rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your
        reasonable attorneys’ fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and
        other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in small claims court of
        competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this
        does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal
        dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the
        arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
        Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Company from
        seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as
        necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
        misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual
        Property Rights, or other proprietary rights. Class Action/Jury Trial
        Waiver. With respect to all persons and entities, regardless of whether
        they have obtained or used the Service for personal, commercial, or
        other purposes, all claims must be brought in the parties’ individual
        capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class
        action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other
        representative proceeding. This waiver applies to class arbitration,
        and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more
        than one person’s claims. You Agree that, by entering into these Terms,
        you and Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to
        participate in a class action, collective action, private attorney
        general action, or other representative proceeding of any kind.
