        Privacy Policy Last Updated: November 30, 2020 This Privacy Policy (the
        “Policy”) explains how Perch Credit, Inc. (“Company,” “we,” “our,” or
        “us”) collects, stores, uses, shares and protects your Personal
        Information, which we obtain when you visit our websites, use our mobile
        application or use our services (collectively, the “Services”). The
        Services are more fully described in the Terms of Use, and such
        description is incorporated therein. You accept this Policy and all of
        its terms whenever you access or use the Services. Remember that your
        use of our Services is at all times subject to our Terms of Service,
        which incorporates this Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without
        defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of
        Service. Our Services are intended for a U.S. audience. If you visit or
        use one of our Services, your information may be transferred or
        processed in the United States. We currently do not offer products or
        services to non-U.S. customers. For purposes of this Policy, “Personal
        Information” means any information that identifies or relates to a
        particular individual and also includes information you provide to us.
        We may create aggregated, de-identified or anonymized data from the
        Personal Information we collect, including by removing information that
        makes the data personally identifiable to a particular member. We may
        use such aggregated, de-identified or anonymized data and share it with
        third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to analyze,
        build and improve the Services and promote our business, provided that
        we will not share such data in a manner that could identify you. Such
        aggregated, de-identified or anonymized data is not considered Personal
        Information. This Policy applies to Personal Information that we gather
        or collect via our Services. This Policy does not apply to any Personal
        Information collected by third-party websites not operated by us. You
        may also email us at supportl@getperch.app or call us at 888-441-3883
        with any privacy-related questions you have. The Information We Collect:
        There are three basic categories of information we collect: Personal
        Information you provide to us; Automatically collected data; and
        Information we get from third parties. Personal Information You Provide
        to Us. We may collect Personal Information that you choose to share with
        us. For example, when you set up an account with us or any partner, we
        need to collect important details about you, such as your name, phone
        number, date of birth, unique username, location, social security number
        and email address. We may also collect any communications between you
        and Company and any other information you provide to Company. We also
        collect Personal Information when you register for or inquire about our
        Services and when you use our Services. You also may submit User Content
        through the Service for us to share with credit-reporting agencies and
        other third parties in support of the Service. Automatically Collected
        Data. We, and our third-party partners, automatically collect certain
        Personal Information when you visit our website, read our emails, access
        or use our Services or otherwise engage with us. This information is
        typically collected through a variety of tracking technologies,
        including cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying
        technologies, file information and other technology (collectively,
        “Tracking Technologies”). We, and our third-party partners, use these
        Tracking Technologies and other tools to automatically collect usage and
        device information, such as: Your IP address, location, browser type,
        Internet service provider, platform type, device type, operating system,
        date and time stamp, a unique ID that allows us to uniquely identify
        your browser, mobile device or your account, your internet service
        provider and other such information. We also collect information about
        the way you use or access our Services, for example, the site from which
        you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our website,
        the pages you visit, the links you click, how frequently you access the
        Services, whether you open emails or click the links contained in
        e-mails, whether you access the Services from multiple devices and other
        actions you take on the Services. When you access our Services from a
        mobile device, we may collect unique identification numbers associated
        with your device or our mobile application (including, for example, a
        UDID, Unique ID for Advertisers (“IDFA”), Google AdID or Windows
        Advertising ID), mobile carrier, device type, model and manufacturer,
        mobile device operating system brand and model, phone number and,
        depending on your mobile device settings, your geographical location
        data, including GPS coordinates (e.g., latitude and/or longitude) or
        similar information regarding the location of your mobile device, or we
        may be able to approximate a device’s location by analyzing other
        information, like an IP address. Do-Not-Track Signals. We are unable to
        respond to Do Not Track signals sent by your browser at this time. If
        you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to
        (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a
        cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable
        existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject

        have no effect on such techniques. You may also set your email options
        to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain
        technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed your
        email and perform certain functions with it. Deleting cookies does not
        delete Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash objects and HTML5. You
        can learn more about Flash objects—including how to manage privacy and
        storage settings for Flash cookies—on Adobe’s website. If you choose to
        delete Flash objects from our sites, then you may not be able to access
        and use all or part of the sites or benefit from the information and
        services offered. Information We Get from Third Parties. We may collect

        interest-based advertising and use third-party advertising companies to
        serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history or
        other information. We may share or we may permit third-party services to
        collect information about your use of our website over time so that they
        may play or display ads on our website or online platform in connection
        with our Service, on other devices you may use and on other websites,
        apps or services. Typically, though not always, the information we share
        is provided through cookies or similar tracking technologies, which
        recognize the device you’re using and collect information, including
        clickstream information, browser type, time and date you visited the
        site and other information. A cookie is a piece of information that the
        computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access
        the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the
        Services, including helping us analyze Services usage more accurately.
        For instance, the Company Site may set a cookie on your browser that
        allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then
        enter a password more than once during a visit to the Company Site. We
        and our third-party partners use this information to make the
        advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well
        as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting,
        attribution, analytics and market research. We, or our third-party
        partners, may link your various devices so that content you see on one
        device can result in relevant advertising on another device. We do this
        by collecting information about each device you use when you are logged
        in to our Services. We may also work with third-party partners that
        employ tracking technologies or the application of statistical modeling
        tools to determine if two or more devices are linked to a single user or
        household. We may share a common account identifier (such as an email
        address or user ID) with third-party advertising partners to help
        recognize you across devices. We, and our partners, can use this
        cross-device linkage to serve interest-based advertising and other
        personalized content to you across your devices, to perform analytics
        and to measure the performance of our advertising campaigns. We may use
        Google Analytics to recognize you and link the devices you use when you
        visit our site or Service on your browser or mobile device, log in to
        your account on our Service or otherwise engage with us. We may share a
        unique identifier, like a user ID or hashed email address, with Google
        to facilitate the Service. Google Analytics allows us to better
        understand how our users interact with our Service and to tailor our
        advertisements and content to you. For information on how Google
        Analytics collects and processes data, as well as how you can control
        information sent to Google, review Google’s site “How Google uses data
        when you use our partners’ sites or apps’’ located at
        www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners. You can learn about Google
        Analytics’ currently available opt-outs, including the Google Analytics
        Browser Ad-On, here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. Please
        review the section title ‘Your choices’ below to understand your choices
        regarding third- party tracking and online advertising. How Long We Keep
        Your Information: We will retain your information for as long as you use
        our Services to resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct
        audits, enforce our agreements and comply with applicable laws or as
        long as we otherwise deem appropriate. We also maintain your Personal
        Information as part of our standard backup procedures. Links to Others’
        Sites and Services: Our Services may contain links to other websites,
        and other websites may reference or link to our Services. These websites
        are operated by third parties not controlled by us and, by linking to
        them or being linked from them, we do not endorse, approve or make any
        representations about third-party websites or domains. We encourage you
        to read the privacy policies of each and every website and domain with
        which you interact. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or
        content of such other websites or domains and you visit them at your own
        risk. Social Media: Our Services may contain links and interactive
        features with various social media platforms. If you already use these
        platforms, their cookies may be set on your device when using our
        Services. You should be aware that Personal Information that you
        voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible social
        media platform, blog or chat room or otherwise online, or that you share
        in an open forum, may be viewed and used by others without any
        restrictions. We have no control over such uses of your information when
        interacting with social media platformsor forums or otherwise online and
        by using such services you assume the risk that the Personal Information
        provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties. How We Store
        Your Personal Information: Your information collected through our
        Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other
        country in which the Company or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or
        service providers maintain facilities or otherwise store information. If
        you are located in other regions with laws governing data collection and
        use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer
        information, including personal information, to a country and
        jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your
        jurisdiction. In addition, information collected about you may be stored
        using cloud-based services. Information stored in the cloud may be
        maintained by third-party networks in locations in which such
        third-party networks operate or maintain data storage or processing
        facilities. Keeping Your Information Safe: We care about the security of
        your information and may employ physical, administrative and
        technological safeguards designed to preserve the integrity and security
        of all information collected through our Services. However, no security
        system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of our
        systems 100%. In the event that any information under our control is
        compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable
        steps to investigate the situation and, where required by law, notify
        those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take
        other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.
        Your Choices: If you receive commercial emails from us, you may
        unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions contained within
        the email. You may also opt-out from receiving commercial email from us
        by sending us an email or by writing to us at the email address given at

        send you certain communications regarding us, and you will not be able
        to opt out of those communications (e.g., communications regarding
        updates to our Privacy Policy). You have choices regarding our use and
        disclosure of your Personal Information. Depending on your location and
        subject to applicable law, you may have the following rights with regard
        to the Personal Information we control about you: (i) the right to
        request confirmation of whether we process Personal Information relating
        to you and, if so, to request a copy of that Personal Information; (ii)
        the right to request that we rectify or update your Personal Information

        provided by law; (iv) the right to request that we restrict the use of

        request that we export to another company, where technically feasible,
        your Personal Information that we hold in order to provide Services to
        you. Where the processing of your Personal Information is based on your
        previously given consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at
        any time. To exercise your rights set forth in this paragraph, you must
        contact us at the email address set forth at the end of this Privacy

        longer hold your Personal Information or we are otherwise not required
        by law to respond to a request. Cookies and Flash Cookies. Most browsers

        receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it;
        (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to
        automatically reject cookies. Blocking or deleting cookies may
        negatively impact your experience using the Services, as some features
        and services on our Services may not work properly. Deleting cookies
        does not delete Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash objects and
        HTML5. To manage Flash cookie settings and preferences, you must use the
        settings manager on Adobe’s website. If you choose to delete Flash
        objects from our Services, then you may not be able to access and use
        all or part of the Services or benefit from the information and services
        offered. Interest-Based Advertising. In the U.S., you can opt out of
        tracking on our website or others for online behavioral advertising by
        visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (the “DAA”) Consumer Choice
        page at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or the Network Advertising
        Initiative’s (the “NAI”) page at
        http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices. You may opt out of receiving
        certain targeted advertising in mobile apps through participating
        members of the DAA by installing the AppChoices mobile app, available at
        https://youradchoices.com/appchoices. Please note that opting out of
        receiving interest-based advertising through the NAI’s and DAA’s online
        resources will only opt out a user from receiving interest-based ads on
        that specific browser or device, but the user may still receive
        interest-based ads on his or her other devices. You must perform the
        opt-out on each browser or device you use. Mobile Advertising. You may
        also be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings on
        your mobile device by selecting “limit ad tracking” (iOS) or “opt-out of
        interest based ads’’ (Android). You may also be able to opt-out of
        some—but not all—interest-based ads served by mobile ad networks by
        visiting http://youradchoices.com/appchoices and downloading the mobile
        App Choices app. Some of these opt-outs may not be effective unless your
        browser is set to accept cookies. If You delete cookies, change your
        browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating
        system, you will need to opt-out again. Changes to This Privacy Policy:

        changes in our business and practices, so you should review this page
        periodically. When we change the policy in a material manner, we will

        majority) years of age, and no part of our Services are directed to
